   "Description" : "Draws a chart with HTML formatted text to enable sub-/superscripts or unusually colored text. Can save or export that chart in WMF (Windows only) or SVG. Can copy that chart, as a bitmap to clipboard (but see below).\n\nHas problems on some Linux versions.\n1. When click the SVG button, fails to load a FreeType font when running in the IDE. OK when standalone. This is due to a defective FreeType font contained in some Linux versions and which our FreeType libs cannot cope with.\n2. When click \"copy to clipboard\", a crash is triggered (it should copy a bitmap image)."}
