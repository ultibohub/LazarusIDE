# Lazarus code editor mini map

This directory contains a mini map:
A small version of a source code window, which can be used to navigate an
overview of the source code.

The map is somewhat configurable (see the Tools-Options dialog):
- Map can be enabled/Disabled
- The width can be set
- The color of the window indicator
- The color of the window indicator text
- The initial size of the text can be set.

You can click in the mini map and the source will jump to the clicked
location

Using ctrl-scroll+mouse wheel will enlarge/shrink the mini map text.

This control is a complete re-implementation based on an idea by 
Domingo Galm√©s, see his plugin:
