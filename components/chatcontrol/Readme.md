# Chat control for lazarus

This package contains 2 controls for lazarus. 
They're installed on the Misc tab of the component palette.

- TChatControl: a basic chat control as you would find it in many
  messenger-like systems 

- TTypingIndicator: a basic animated 'typing' bubble. It is used to indicate
  that the left or right side of the conversation is "typing" in the chat control.

There is a chat demo in the demo directory, that shows how the TChatControl can be used.
